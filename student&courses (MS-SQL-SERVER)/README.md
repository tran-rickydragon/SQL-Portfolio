<br>This is a database I created in Microsoft SQL Server to store student information and courses from the University of Houston website
<br>I have inserts for the computer science and digital media degree programs with core clases as well
<br>Then I connected students with their respective degree and courses
<br>I wrote queries and views to view data
<br>I also created 3 triggers for the DB
